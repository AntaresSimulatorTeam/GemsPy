# andromede-modeling-prototype
Prototype to design future modeling capabilities for Antares simulator.

The repository consists in:
- [src/andromede](./src/andromede):
  python package that implements the concepts (models, ports)
  and allow for basic simulation using them.
- [tests](./tests):
  python tests illustrating the use and behaviour of the concepts
- [models-design](./models-design):
  mainly schemas to design the models that one could implement
  using our concepts.
